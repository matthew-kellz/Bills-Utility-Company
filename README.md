# Bills-Utility-Company
This is my first ever coding project in python in my Intro to Programming class taken in the autumn semester. It received a grade A. 
The project required reading and writing to a .csv file and conducting many different analytical tasks on the selection of bills used. Use of pandas and other similar packages were forbidden as it aimed to test our working knowledge of lists and other python classes and data structures.
